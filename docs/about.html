        <h1>What is the project goal?</h1>
        <p>Through analysis of the text, we understand that people of New York in 1890 were subjected to deplorable lives in an era where the ideas of social reform were new, and laws struggled to keep up with hardened criminals or negligent landlords.</p>
        
        <h1>How was markup conducted?</h1>
        <p>A color-coded view of a transcript from the original book will allow users of the site to filter sections or instances of the text to highlight housing and working conditions, crime, death and other notable areas of coverage. Chapters of the book were
            marked up by hand to evaluate their content, and then were processed into an interactive reading view using XSLT as a markup. To aid the reader, the original tables contained within the book have been presented where they appeared
            originally.</p>
        
        <h1>What challenges did the team face?</h1>
        <p>Project Riis and its small band of three people were initially skeptical about the potential for analysis presented, yet the book's title was hidden in plain sight:  <i>How do the other half live?</i></p> 
        Inspiration was drawn from past projects that examined the themes of presidential State of the Union and inaugural addresses for their thematic contents. Preserving original formatting of the book and its antiquated layout of chapters provided a formidable challenge,
        and also, sections where Riis waxes poetic about a given subject are well crafted, but were ultimately unnecessary in the final stages of analysis. 
 
        
      <h1>What are the photos on the site?</h1>
        <p>Photographs and illustrations included on the site depict the life and people of New York City during the period when Riis dedicated time behind the lens to enhance his journalism. Contemporary images from other sources, like the 1879 depiction of 
        a sagging wood-framed tenament house are presented to aid understanding for our readers.</p>
        
        <h1>What conclusions were made?</h1>
        <p>As the book was at the time of its publication, the details contained within are uncomfortable and speak of a troubled city before the age of social reform that experienced rapid, unsustainable growth. The number of characters in each chapter
        overwhelmingly point towards housing conditions as the city's primary weakness, while Riis also includes a consistent presence regarding the lives of immigrant groups. Topical chapters, such as 19 include heavy focus on a particular theme. In this case, 
        crime and punishment are the core focus in the section. </p>
