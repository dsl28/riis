        <h1>What is the project goal?</h1>
        <p>Through analysis of the text, we understand that people of New York in 1890 were subjected to deplorable lives in an era where the ideas of social reform were new, and laws struggled to keep up with hardened criminals or negligent landlords.</p>
        
        <h1>How was markup conducted?</h1>
        <p>A color-coded view of a transcript from the original book will allow users of the site to filter sections or instances of the text to highlight housing and working conditions, crime, death and other notable areas of coverage. </p>
        
      <h1>What are the photos on the site?</h1>
        <p>Markup inside the text includes photographs and illustrations which were present in the book to add context to the words of Riis.  </p>
