        <p>is a senior history major with a love for railroads and industrial history. As it ties into the US's rapid urbanization at the end of the 19th century, <i>How The Other Half Lives</i> is a landmark 
            work that speaks to society's shift away from an agrarian way of living. I can typically be found researching niche topics, fixing antique equipment, or enjoying the hobby of model railroading.
