        <p>is a senior history major with a love for railroads and industrial history. As it ties into the US's rapid urbanization at the end of the 19th century, <i>How The Other Half Lives</i> is a landmark 
            work that speaks to society's shift away from an agrarian way of living. I can typically be found researching niche topics, fixing antique equipment, or enjoying the hobby of model railroading. 
            While the scenes that Riis photographed are filled with people, much of my own photography reflects the beauty of the manmade world and the absence of life in decaying industrial zones.  </p>

            Hello! I am a Junior history major and education minor at pitt greensburg. I had heard about <i>How the other half lives</i> in several of my previous history courses but this was my first in depth look at the work.
            I am grateful that I had the opportunity to work on this project as it helped me deepen my understanding of the living conditions in new york in 1890. Outside of school I am usually building models or playing videogames.
